  <p>Games where experience points are earned for collecting money are pretty great, but sometimes stumble when it comes to how they players will spend that money. Many referees I've talked to about this prefer various methods where the players don't really receive any added benefit for having money, it's just siphoned off them in one way or another. Perhaps training for a new level costs money, or perhaps experience points are only gained by wasting money on trivialities, etc. It's a good way to prevent the game from spiraling out of control. After all, the players are already getting XP for the money, letting them spend it on something that will help them is kinda allowing them to double dip. None the less, I do not find it satisfying. My preference is that players mostly use their funds to invest in territories and infrastructure, and begin playing at domain building. But it's also nice for them to occasionally buy something interesting to tinker with, or at ool that will help them.</p> 

  <p>I like the idea of players being able to purchase a magic sword. (As an example). But I only like it if the players aren't really in control. In various forms I've been doing this for a long time. My paleolithic D&D&LB campaign had a caravan system where carts would roll through the home base occasionally, carrying random valuable items. Later campaigns used curio shops, which I stole from Necropraxis and have been developing ever since.</p> 
    
  <p>Most recently I've been running a megadungeon campaign where I very early on decided that the players would need to choose what to do with their loot. Either they could return it to their struggling community, extending that community's survival, and gaining experience points as a reward. *OR* they could spend it at a market run by goblins, where they'd be able to find different forms of interesting gear and loot. </p>
    
  <p>I forgot to actually come up with how to stock this market blah blah blah, what I came up with is cool. </p>
